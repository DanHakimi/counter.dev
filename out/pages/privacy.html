<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This privacy policy will explain how we use the personal data we collect from
you when you use our website.</p>
<h2>What data do we collect?</h2>

    tracking script.</li>
<li>Your browser&rsquo;s time zone, a preference that can be changed in the account
    settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your personalized tracking script aggregates the following statistical information of your users.</p>
<ul>
<li>The day of the week (As in: <em>Monday</em>, <em>Tuesday</em>, &hellip;)</li>
<li>Your users device (As in <em>Phone</em>, <em>Tablet</em> or <em>Computer</em>)</li>
<li>The date of the visit</li>
<li>From which other website a visit originated.</li>
