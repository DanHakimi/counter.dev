## Technology
Simple Web Analytics is a small go server, that saves everything to redis.

## AGPL Licensed
Simple Web Analytics is Open Source mainly for transparency. Although you of
course can self host it, at the moment I am not focusing on a self hosted
solution.

## Development Philosophy
The project still has a prototypish character and I will try to stay "lean" as long as possible.
